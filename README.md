# Python-Guessing-Game
This little game was developed as a simple school project involving library importation. It was made and tested with IDLE but can be run in any Python environment
  you like, including online environments like Replit.com. 
To run it from the command line of a Python compatible system, simply download the file and double-click it (on windows) or type "python HighLowMain.py" (in BASH.)
